> When you have an issue, you can’t approach a group [ [[Infrastructure Council]] ]; you need a specific person you know you can turn to. This is what your steward is for. They won’t solve every problem, but they are your point of contact to make sure the problem gets solved. If you don't know who to go to, you can always go to them.
